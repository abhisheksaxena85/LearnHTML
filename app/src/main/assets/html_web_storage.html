        The Web Storage is one of the
great features of HTML5. With the
Web Storage feature, web
applications can locally store
data within the browser on the
client side. It stores doata in the
form of key/value pair on the
browser. Web Storage sometimes
also known as DOM storage. <br><br>
Storing data with the help of web
storage is similar to cookies, but it
is better and faster than cookies. <br><br>
In compared to cookies Web
Storage has Following
Advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Storage can use
            storage space upto 5MB per
            domain. (The browser
            software may prompt the
            user if the space limit is
            reached).</li>
        <li>It will not send data to the
            server side, hence it is faster
            than cookies storage.</li>
        <li>The data stored by local
            Storage never expires, but
            cookies data expires after
            Some time or session.</li>
        <li>Web Storage is more secure
            than cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><hr>
    <h2>Types of Web Storage</h2>
    <p>There are two types of web storage with different scope and lifetime.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Storage: Local Storages
            uses Windows.localStaorage
            object which stores data and
            available for every page. But
            data persist even if the
            browser is closed and
            reopened (Stores data with
            no Expiration).</li>
        <li>Session Storage: Session
            Storage uses
            Windows.sessionStorage
            object which stores data for
            one session and data will be
            lost if the window or browser
            tab will be closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><hr>
    <h2>Browser support for Web Storage</h2>
    <p>Before learning for web Storage
        we must check whether our
        browser is supporting the web
        Storage or not. </p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Browser support for Web Storage</h2>    
    <p>
        The localStorage object stores
data locally within the browser.
The data stored by localStroage
object does not have any
expiration date. Hence the stored
data will not be deleted if the
browser is closed or reopened. <br><br>
Each piece of data is stored in
simple key-value pairs. The key/
values are always stored as
String, and can be accessed with
localstorage.getitem() and
localStorage.setitem() methods.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The sessionStorage Object:</h2>
    <p>The sessionStorage object is
        same as the localStorage object,
        but the difference is that it stores
        data only for one session. If you
        close the browser, then data will
        be lost or deleted.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Remove Web Storage:</h2>    
    <p>
        As we have seen the session
storage data will automatically
deleted, when you close the
browser but the data saved by
local storage will remain in the
browser even if you clOse it. <br><br>
Hence to delete the local storage
data, you need to call two
methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>localStorage.removeltem(ke
            y): If yu want to delete the
            value on a particular key,
            then you can use the "key,"
            and that value will be
            deleted.</li>
        <li>localstorage.clear(): If you
            Want to delete or clear all
            settings with key/value pair,
            then yOu can call this
            method.</li>
    </ul>
