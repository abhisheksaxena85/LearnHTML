    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">HTML is an acronym which stands for<B> Hyper Text Markup Language</B> which is used for
    creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web Page.
    <br><br><b>Hyper Text :</b> HyperText simply means "Text within Text". A text has a link within it, is a hypertext.
    Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way
    to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
    <br><br>
    <b>Markup Language :</b> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
    conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into
    images, tables, links, etc.
    <br><br>
    <b>Web Page :</b> A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page
    can be identified by entering and URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we
    can create static web pages.
    <br>
    <br>Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which
    looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different
    content.
    <br><br>
    <b>Let's see a simple example of HTML</b>
    </p>

    <div id="code_container">
        <div id="code_header">
            <div id="code_title">
                <img src="code (1).svg"/>
                <p>Code Example</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="code_body">
            <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; 
                <br>&lt;html&gt; <br>
                &lt;head&gt; <br>
                &lt;title&gt;Web page title&lt;/title&gt;
                <br>&lt;/head&gt;
                <br>&lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;h1&gt;Write Your First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                &lt;p&gt;Write Your First Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                &lt/html&gt;
            </p>

    <h2>Description of HTML Example</h2>
    <p><b>&lt!DOCTYPE&GT; :</b> It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML. 
        <br><br>
        <b>&lthtml&GT; :</b> This tag informs the browser that it is is an HTML document. Text between html tag describes the web document. It is a container for all other elements of HTML except &lt;!DOCTYPE&GT;
        <br><br>
        <b>&lt;head&GT; :</b> It should be the first element inside the &lt;html&gt; element, which contains the metadata (Information about document). It must be closed before the body tag opens.
        <br><br>
        <b>&lt;title&GT; :</b> As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which apprears at the top of the browser window. It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately. (Optional)
        <br><br>
        <b>&lt;body&GT; :</b> Text between body tag describes the body content of the page that is visible to the end user. This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.
        <br><br>
        <b>&lt;h1&GT; :</b> Text between &lt;h1&GT; tag describes the first level heading of the webpage.
        <br><br>
        <b>&lt;p&GT; :</b> Text between &lt;p&GT; tag describes the paragraph of the webpage.

    <h2>Brief  History of HTML</h2>
    <p>In late 1980's, a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.
